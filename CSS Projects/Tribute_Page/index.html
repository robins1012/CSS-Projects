            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on December 22, 1887, in Erode, Tamil Nadu, India. He grew up in Kumbakonam,
                where his
                father worked as a clerk and his mother was a housewife and a singer at a local temple. Ramanujan showed
                an early talent
                for mathematics, excelling in the subject during his school years.</p>
            <h2>Education and Early Career</h2>
            <p>Despite his brilliance in mathematics, Ramanujan struggled with other subjects and eventually dropped out
                of formal
                education. He continued to study mathematics independently, developing his own theories and solutions to
                complex
                problems.</p>
            <h2>Mathematical Contributions</h2>
            <p>Ramanujan’s work is renowned for its originality and depth. Some of his key contributions include:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Infinite Series and Continued Fractions: Ramanujan developed new formulas and theorems in
                    theseareas, some of which were groundbreaking at the time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Partition Function: He made significant contributions to the partition of numbers, which involves
                    expressing a number as
                    the sum of other numbers.
                </li>
                <li>Ramanujan Prime: He introduced the concept of Ramanujan primes, a special type of prime number.</li>
                <li>Hardy-Ramanujan Number (1729): This number is famously known for its unique properties, discovered
                    during a conversation
                    between Ramanujan and G.H. Hardy.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Collaboration with G.H. Hardy</h2>
            <p>In 1913, Ramanujan sent a letter to G.H. Hardy, a prominent British mathematician, detailing some of his
                findings.
                Recognizing Ramanujan's extraordinary talent, Hardy invited him to Cambridge University. Ramanujan
                traveled to England
                in 1914 and worked closely with Hardy, producing several important papers and expanding the boundaries
                of mathematical
                knowledge.</p>
            <h2>Personal Struggles and Health Issues</h2>
            <p>During his time in England, Ramanujan faced significant health challenges exacerbated by the cold climate
                and dietary
                restrictions. Despite these difficulties, his work remained highly productive. He returned to India in
                1919 due to his
                deteriorating health.</p>
            <h2>Legacy and Honors</h2>
            <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan passed away on April 26, 1920, at the age of 32. His work has had a lasting impact on
                mathematics,
                influencing various fields such as number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Several
                honors and
                institutions bear his name, such as the Ramanujan Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics and the
                Ramanujan Prize
                for young mathematicians from developing countries.</p>
            <h2>Notable Publications</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>"Notebooks": Filled with thousands of theorems and mathematical concepts, many of which were later
                    validated by
                    mathematicians.
                </li>
                <li>"Collected Papers of Srinivasa Ramanujan": A compilation of his published work.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Quotes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>"An equation for me has no meaning unless it expresses a thought of God."
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Commemoration</h2>
            <p>Ramanujan’s birthday, December 22, is celebrated as National Mathematics Day in India. His life and work
                have been the
                subject of several books and films, including the biography "The Man Who Knew Infinity" by Robert
                Kanigel, which was
                adapted into a movie starring Dev Patel as Ramanujan.</p>
